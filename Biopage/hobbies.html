    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p style="width:500px">One of my main hobbies is video games. I played a lot of video games over the years, since I was a kid I always liked video games probably because I used to play them a lot when I was in DR but I also think playing video games is one of the reasons I chose Cybersecurity.</p>
