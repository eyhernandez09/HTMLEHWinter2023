    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p style="width:500px">I am from the Dominican Republic. I came to the United States in 2018. I graduated highschool 2022. After highschool I decided that I wanted to go to college and that's one of the reasons I'm here. I chose Cybersecurity as my major because since a kid I've always been around computers and I wanted to learn more about Networking and how everything really work. After college I'm looking forward to keep doing what I like to do and get a good job that pays well and probably into real estate, stocks, etc.
