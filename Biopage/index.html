    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p style="width:500px">I am from the Dominican Republic. I came to the United States five years ago. I speak Spanish. I work at Walmart and Iâ€™m also a student at New England Tech Institute. One of my hobbies is lying down in my bed with my airpods while listening to music for an hour or two. </p>
